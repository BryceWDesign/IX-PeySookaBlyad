### 🔋 **Free Wireless Charging**

Place your phone flat on the shelf to charge — **no cable needed.**  
Device must support **Qi wireless charging**.  
Charging will begin automatically if energy is available.

> ⚠️ Charging is **disabled during storms** to prioritize flood removal.

### 💧 **This Tower Fights Flooding**

This structure collects rain and floodwater,  
converts it to hydrogen and oxygen,  
and safely releases it back into the air.

**No water is stored. No fuel is hoarded. No danger.**  
Just clean energy from the storm itself.

## 🈹 Tagalog Version (suggested translation)

(*Note: have this reviewed by native Tagalog speaker before deployment*)

**Libreng Wireless Charging**  
Ilagay ang iyong telepono sa estante upang mag-charge.  
Walang kailangang cable. Gumagana lamang ito sa mga phone na may Qi charging.  

**Babala:** Kapag umuulan ng malakas, **pansamantalang hindi pinapagana ang charging**.

**Tinutulungan ng tore na ito na alisin ang baha**  
Ipinoproseso ang tubig-ulan at ligtas na inilalabas sa hangin.

**Walang imbak. Walang panganib.**  
**Tulong lang.**

## ✅ Summary

This is where **technology meets trust.**  
No paywalls. No BS. Just light, power, and flood control — one sign at a time.
