# Flood Zone Mapping Guidelines — IX-PeySookaBlyad

Smart technology is useless without smart placement.  
This guide defines **how to choose locations** for tower deployment that will **actually reduce flooding** — not just look good on a grant application.

## 🗺️ Step-by-Step Deployment Strategy

---

### 1. **Identify Urban Flood Basins**
Use existing flood maps, government data, or on-ground reports to locate:
- Low-elevation streets or intersections
- Regular shoulder-high flooding zones
- Overflow-prone drains or blocked canals

> 🧠 Pro Tip: Use community WhatsApp/FB group images from past floods to geo-reference real pain points.

---

### 2. **Use Elevation + Permeability Map Layers**
Overlay:
- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** for street-level slope
- **Soil permeability layers** to locate hard, low-absorption zones

> Priority is **low zones + low soil drainage + population density**

---

### 3. **Spacing Recommendations**

| Area Type             | Recommended Tower Spacing |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Densely urban         | Every 8–12 meters         |
| Residential street    | Every 20–25 meters        |
| Intersection cluster  | 3 towers in triangle      |
| Canal or drain edge   | Every 6–10 meters         |

---

### 4. **Cluster Pattern Optimization**

- In critical zones, towers should form **triangular or grid layouts**
- Allow towers to share environmental data (via mesh, BLE sync)
- Each unit must be fully functional on its own — **no daisy chaining**

---

### 5. **Ingress Avoidance Zones**
Do *not* deploy towers:
- Inside vehicle traffic lanes
- Near schoolyard fence lines (avoid tampering)
- On soft earth without reinforced base
- Too close to existing drainage inlets (redundancy)

---

## 🧮 Deployment Calculation Formula

```text
T = (A × R) / (C × D)
```

Where:
- `T` = Required number of towers  
- `A` = Total at-risk area (m²)  
- `R` = Average rainfall rate (mm/hour)  
- `C` = Per-tower intake capacity (liters/hour)  
- `D` = Average deployment density factor (efficiency multiplier, 0.6–1.0)

---

## 🧠 Field Tips

- Partner with barangay captains or city engineers  
- Use drone imaging post-rain to catch mini-pool zones  
- Look for algae rings on building sides — shows historical flood line  
- Never trust city flood plans without confirming **on-foot**  
- Community surveys = deployment gold

## ✅ Summary

You don’t guess where a tower goes. You **hunt it**.  
Every drain that fails is a mission. Every inch of floodwater is a callout.  
These aren’t decorations — they’re defenses.  
**Map smart. Place hard. Flood never.**
