# Intake Skirt Assembly — IX-PeySookaBlyad

The intake skirt is the bottom flood-facing section of the tower. It enables **ground-level floodwater suction** while preventing clogging, backflow, and rodent/insect intrusion. This is the primary path for consuming pooled rainwater.

## 🧱 Physical Design

- **Diameter**: Matches tower width (~3 feet)
- **Height**: 8–12 inches tall (base-level ring skirt)
- **Gap from ground**: 1 inch minimum, up to 1.5 inches in low-flood zones
- **Structure**: Reinforced rubber + steel rib inner core

## 🛡️ Material Layer Breakdown

1. **Outer Shield Layer**:
   - Material: Recycled tire rubber + EVA blend
   - Shape: Slightly flared outward (lip-style), resists blunt impact
   - Function: Protects intake gap from side trash, provides flex on impact

2. **Perimeter Intake Mesh**:
   - Material: Galvanized steel mesh (3–5mm grid)
   - Wrapped inside rubber skirt
   - Prevents rats, leaves, bottles, plastic bags from entry

3. **Hidden Water Channel Slot**:
   - 1-inch tall intake slot behind mesh
   - Channels water directly into internal sump chamber via cone intake

4. **Debris Trap Ledge**:
   - Internal ledge + optional removable foam strip for capturing finer debris
   - Optional upgrade for areas with heavy microtrash or oil

## 🌀 Water Flow Behavior

- Suction or passive gravity allows water to flow into bottom skirt
- Water flows around entire circular perimeter → center funnel → sump
- Combined with top intake = dual-channel water draw (high & low)

---

## 🐀 Pest Resistance

- 3–5mm steel mesh = impassable by rats, frogs, snakes
- Mesh is angled at 20° inward to prevent chewing or force entry
- Optionally lined with peppermint oil pads or citronella pouches for anti-insect behavior

---

## 🔧 Maintenance Access

- Skirt is secured via 3–4 removable bolts with rubber washers
- Mesh grid can be pulled for cleaning in less than 5 minutes
- Foam filter is optional, washable, and field-replaceable

---

## ⚙️ Integration Notes

- Water from skirt is funneled into electrolysis chamber or overflow pit directly
- No electrical components in the skirt — purely passive mechanical intake
- Designed to survive impact from foot traffic, delivery carts, scooters

## ✅ Summary

The intake skirt is the **unsung hero** of this build.  
It’s low. It’s dirty. It gets kicked. It gets hit. But it **never stops drinking**.  
Designed for real streets, real floods, and the chaos that comes with them.
