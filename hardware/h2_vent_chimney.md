# Hydrogen Vent Chimney — IX-PeySookaBlyad

This is the **hydrogen exhaust chimney**, designed to safely disperse any H₂ gas produced by the electrolysis module.

It must be:

- **Non-pressurized**
- **Non-explosive**
- **Directional**
- **Weatherproof**
- **Fail-safe, even during high winds**

This is not a tank. This is a **safe atmospheric gateway** — clean H₂ enters, gently rises, and disperses.

## 🔩 Mechanical Design

| Component       | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Stack Shape     | Vertical cylinder, ~3" diameter, 18–24" height      |
| Mouth Opening   | Downward 90° elbow w/ screened vent                 |
| Flow Geometry   | Laminar riser + passive draft boost                 |
| Drainage        | Small weep holes for rain egress                    |
| Materials       | Heat-tolerant PVC or aluminum alloy                 |
| Sealing Base    | Silicone gasket + lock ring                         |

## 🌬️ Flow Logic

- Hydrogen gas (lighter than air) rises naturally
- No fans required — passive buoyancy drives exhaust
- Elbow at top **prevents water ingress** and **directs flow**
- Optional one-way silicone flap to reduce backdrafts

## 🔧 Installation

- Connect base to tower’s upper electrolysis exhaust port  
- Chimney mounted vertically with elbow facing **downward**  
- Screws + silicone gasket ensure gas-tight but vent-open flow  
- Optional: hydrophobic mesh inside elbow mouth for extreme storm protection

## 🧪 Safety and Environmental Notes

| Check                          | Result                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| H₂ ignition risk               | None — gas disperses instantly   |
| Water ingress protection       | Top elbow blocks vertical entry  |
| Bug and rodent blocking        | Stainless screen verified        |
| Corrosion resistance           | All-weather rated parts used     |
| Pressure buildup risk          | Zero (non-pressurized system)    |

## ✅ Why This Matters

Hydrogen is beautiful. But only if it **leaves quickly**, **never pools**, and **never comes back in**.

This vent makes sure every molecule goes up, out, and away — even in the middle of a typhoon.

If a system breathes water, it dies.  
This one **breathes sky.**
