# Top Rain Intake Cover — IX-PeySookaBlyad

This module details the design of the **top-mounted rain intake system** — the high-dome screen located at the top of the tower, responsible for safely collecting rainfall while blocking debris, animals, and tampering.

---

## ☔ Primary Objectives

- Collect direct rainfall efficiently
- Prevent large debris and insects from entering
- Remain unobstructed during downpours
- Resist UV, heat, and physical abuse (rocks, sticks, impact)
- Vent air to avoid negative pressure or water lock

---

## 🧱 Physical Design

- **Shape**: Domed disc (~2.5 feet diameter)
- **Mount height**: Top of tower (~9 ft above ground)
- **Mount style**: Ring clamp or threaded insert
- **Dome material**: Frosted polycarbonate shell with steel mesh underlay

---

## 🧰 Layered Construction

### 1. **Outer Shell (Top Dome)**  
- Material: Frosted polycarbonate or PETG  
- UV-resistant, impact-resistant  
- Gently domed to shed water during downpours  
- Light-scattering surface optionally glows via LED bleed  

### 2. **Inner Mesh Layer**  
- Material: Stainless steel 304 wire mesh  
- Grid: 1–2mm spacing  
- Purpose: Prevents leaves, large insects, rodents, or hand entry  
- Secured via vertical tension anchors below cap ring  

### 3. **Ventilation Channels**  
- Gap between dome and tower top: ~10mm circumferential clearance  
- Purpose: Allows warm air to escape and water vapor to flow upward  
- Prevents stagnation and negative intake suction

## 🐞 Insect & Weather Resistance

- Stainless mesh = wasp- and mosquito-proof
- Optional: fine nylon screen overlay for tropical environments
- Water-shedding dome resists bird nesting and dust clogging
- Dome can be coated with hydrophobic finish for better runoff

---

## 🔩 Installation & Access

- Mounted with 4–6 tamper-resistant bolts (Torx or hex cap)
- Entire dome removes upward for full chamber access
- Mesh ring is pressure-clipped beneath dome and can be cleaned separately

---

## 💡 LED Integration Option

- Optional low-voltage LED ring may be placed under dome rim
- Emits upward halo glow during system activity or night
- Powered via same line as beacon light

---

## 🌊 Water Flow Path

- Rain falls into dome and flows directly into internal funnel
- Joins sump water via vertical pipe
- Water is either electrolyzed or passed to overflow if power unavailable

---

## ✅ Summary

The top rain intake is **your eye to the sky**.  
It takes the hit. It collects the storm. It glows in the dark.  
And it *never* clogs — because lives can’t wait for maintenance.
