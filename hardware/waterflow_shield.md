# Waterflow Shield Intake Cap ‚Äî IX-PeySookaBlyad

This is the **top-side intake protector** ‚Äî the rain gateway that lets water flow while:

- Blocking trash and leaves  
- Blocking rodents  
- Blocking mosquitos and larvae  
- Never choking air or water throughput

Designed to stay open even in extreme rain. Zero clogs. Zero backup. Total flow-through.

## üîß Installation & Maintenance

- Mesh ring fastens onto upper tower rim with 4-point latching clips  
- Dome is not removable by public, but can be unscrewed for maintenance  
- Drain channel cut along inside funnel to minimize debris buildup  
- Recommended clean-out: once every 60‚Äì90 days (if in dense urban zone)

## ‚úÖ Summary

This cap is the lungs of the tower.

It doesn‚Äôt just let water in ‚Äî it **keeps the bad stuff out** while letting the system breathe.

Because if the top gets blocked, the flood wins.  
We don‚Äôt let it get that far.
