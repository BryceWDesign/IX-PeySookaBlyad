# Field Deployment Strategy — IX-PeySookaBlyad

This document outlines **how**, **where**, and **how far apart** to deploy IX-PeySookaBlyad towers in real-world environments.

The goal is **maximum water capture**, **energy utilization**, and **public utility access**, with minimum material waste and site disruption.

## 🧠 Core Principles

1. **Let the rain fall** — do not intercept or re-route it unnaturally.
2. **Harvest and vent on-site** — no central holding tanks.
3. **Treat every tower as a standalone autonomous node.**
4. **Cluster for redundancy in zones of known flood recurrence.**

## 📏 Recommended Spacing

| Zone Type        | Distance Between Units |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Dense Urban Core | Every **8–10 meters**  |
| Suburban Roads   | Every **15–20 meters** |
| Sloped Drainways | Every **5–8 meters**   |
| Dead Zones       | Minimum 1 unit per block corner |

Why 10 meters?  
That’s the **approximate horizontal spread radius** during shoulder-depth urban flood events — based on Manila, Jakarta, and Cebu 10-year datasets.

## 📍 Site Selection Criteria

| Consideration         | Deployment Rule                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Traffic Flow          | Place units near curb edges, away from center lanes   |
| Power Proximity       | Optional — towers are fully off-grid capable          |
| Rainfall Runoff Path  | Prioritize known street dips and sewer entry areas    |
| Public Use            | Phone shelf should face pedestrian path               |
| Sunlight Access       | Ideal but not mandatory (solar is supplemental only)  |
| Emergency Access      | Avoid blocking medical or evac lanes                  |

## 🔧 Installation Protocol

| Step | Action                                       |
|-----:|----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Dig 3ft wide, 1.5ft deep reinforced pit      |
| 2    | Install drainage basin + mosquito screen     |
| 3    | Anchor tower with concrete/epoxy rebar set   |
| 4    | Verify level alignment + cap with dome       |
| 5    | Run LED diagnostic + water detection test    |
| 6    | Confirm wireless charging and RF harvest     |
| 7    | Finalize: beacon goes green, tower goes live |

## 🛠️ Maintenance Access Zones

| Role             | Tools Needed       | Frequency     |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| City Maintenance | Tri-driver, flush kit | Every 6 months |
| Civilian Public  | None               | Passive access only |
| Emergency Override | NFC fob (future upgrade) | As needed |

---

## 🌐 Future Interconnect Option (Optional)

If scaled across a city block:

- Towers can optionally be mesh-networked using LoRa/ESP-NOW
- Cluster relays aggregate rainfall telemetry and send to a cloud server
- Server maps water saturation levels in near real-time
- Triggers auto-deployment of city crews or alerts

## ✅ Why This Matters

If one tower saves one phone, one life, or one breath of air during a flood — it worked.

But when you **deploy them like a grid**, they become a **civil defense network**.  
No wires. No server rooms. Just towers... quietly doing the work.

And that’s the point.
