# Contributing to IX-PeySookaBlyad

Welcome, collaborator.  
This is not a product. It’s not a startup. It’s not a trap to harvest your time or steal your credit.

This project is **a gift to humanity** — for people who wake up every season ankle-deep in floodwater, with no government help, and no corporate backup.

We’re building something they can deploy with their own hands.  
If you want to help, read on.

## 🧠 Golden Rules

1. **No monetization.**  
   If you’re here to sell this tech, fork it and remove the name.

2. **No DRM, paywalls, or token walls.**  
   All derivative works must remain freely accessible.

3. **Protect the core logic.**  
   Don’t allow fantasy, pseudoscience, or fiction to enter any modules.

4. **Credit everyone, including field implementers.**  
   Respect is currency here.

5. **Build to reality.**  
   If it can’t be built in Manila with a wrench, it doesn’t belong in this repo.

## 🌍 Why This Project Exists

This system is for **urban survival** — not as a concept, but as **a daily lived need**.

We don’t want likes. We don’t need logos.  
We want families dry during typhoon season, and maybe even someone’s phone charged to call their mother.

If that resonates with you, build.

Welcome aboard.
