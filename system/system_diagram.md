## ðŸ§± PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

**Height:** ~9 feet  
**Base Width:** ~3 feet (cylindrical)  
**Core Material:** Composite â€“ recycled rubber, ABS, steel mesh, and local concrete ballast  
**Top Intake Cover:** Weather-shielded, debris-blocking rain entry mesh  
**Bottom Intake Skirt:** ~1 inch clearance from ground, includes steel mesh screen for rodent/insect prevention  
**Charging Ring:** ~4 feet high, embedded Qi wireless shelf with weather overhang  
**Light Beacon:** LED ring or dome on top, always-on if energy available

## ðŸ§  INTERNAL SUBSYSTEMS

### 1. ðŸ’§ Water Collection Intake
- **Top Mesh Inlet**: Captures rainfall directly
- **Bottom Skirt Suction**: Draws pooled street water (active or passive draw)
- **Debris Screens**: Protects intake systems from clogging

### 2. âš¡ Energy Harvest & Management
- **Solar Panel Ring (Upper Canopy)**
- **Ground Resonance Coil (Tesla-style pickup)**
- **RF Energy Scavenger (Optional)**
- **Thermoelectric Harvester (Peltier stack between internal/external zones)**
- **Piezo Panel Option (for high-traffic zones)**  
- All sources charge a **central capacitor bank** or direct-feed electrolysis

### 3. ðŸ”¥ Hydrogen Electrolysis Module
- Rainwater is funneled into a **sealed electrolysis chamber**
- Converts Hâ‚‚O â†’ Hâ‚‚ + Oâ‚‚ using stainless steel or nickel plate electrodes
- **Hydrogen is NOT stored** â€” vented immediately via chimney vent cap
- **Oxygen is passively released** through secondary outgas port

### 4. ðŸ”‹ Wireless Public Charging
- Qi wireless coil embedded in recessed shelf at 4ft height
- Charging shelf is weather-shielded and pressure-tested
- Phones require only proximity for acces
