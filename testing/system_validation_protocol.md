# System Validation Protocol ‚Äî IX-PeySookaBlyad

This document defines the **full testing checklist and validation methods** for ensuring that each PeySooka tower unit functions correctly **before field deployment**.

All tests must be conducted **on-site or at staging area** before live use.

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

You don't win public trust with press releases.

You earn it by **never deploying a unit that fails the checklist**.

This isn't just quality control ‚Äî it's **life control**. When you're knee-deep in water and still have signal on your phone‚Ä¶  
that‚Äôs not an accident.

That‚Äôs a tower that passed **this test**.
