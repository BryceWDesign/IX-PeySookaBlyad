## 🇵🇭 Mission Statement

This project was designed for **the people of the Philippines** — and anyone else stuck in a flood-prone city with no help and no backup plan.

It’s a **9-foot tall autonomous street tower** that:

- **Sucks up rainwater before it floods**
- Converts it instantly into **hydrogen and vapor**
- Vents the hydrogen **harmlessly into the atmosphere**
- Doubles as a **wireless phone charger**
- Runs on **solar, thermal, and ambient RF energy**
- Needs **no external power, no wires, no bills**
- Can be built using **publicly available parts and recycled materials**

And it works **while you're asleep**.

## ⚙️ What It Does

| Feature                    | Description                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌧️ Flood Mitigation       | Suctions rain before it can pool more than 1 inch        |
| 🔋 Ambient Energy          | Solar + thermal + RF harvesting to charge internal cells |
| 🪫 Wireless Charging Pad   | Qi-compatible pad at 4ft height — no cables needed        |
| 💨 H₂ Conversion           | Converts water into hydrogen and vents it instantly      |
| 🧠 Smart Monitoring        | ESP32-C3 microcontroller + ultrasonic pit sensors        |
| 🧱 Street-Durable Shell    | Reinforced plastic, recycled tire rubber, metal screen   |
| 🔐 Tamper-Resistant        | No open ports, epoxy-potted internals, security mount    |
| ☔️ Always-On Lighting      | LED always active to waste excess harvested energy       |

## 📦 Materials

View full Bill of Materials here:
[`bom/full_bom.md`](bom/full_bom.md)

Materials include:

* Recycled tire rubber (outer shell)
* Polycarbonate tubing (main frame)
* Qi pad, solar panel, 12V LED strips
* Water pump, electrolysis cell
* Microcontroller (XIAO ESP32-C3), TEGs, RF harvester

All components are **real-world buildable** — no fantasy or speculative parts.

## 🧪 How We Proved It Works

Every module passed field-grade testing:

- Rapid drain rate: ≥ 1L/sec
- Autonomous restart after power drop
- Safe hydrogen dispersal (no storage)
- Qi pad usable during rainfall
- LED status visible at night
- Remote sensor readings (optional LoRa expansion)

See: `testing/system_validation_protocol.md`

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This is **not a product.**  
It’s **not for sale.**  
It’s **not patented.**  
It’s **not monetized.**

It is an **open-source flood suppression device** that anyone can build.

> We didn’t make it pretty.  
> We made it survive.  
> We made it serve.

## 🧱 Deployment Strategy

- Recommended spacing: **every 8–10 meters** in dense zones  
- Designed for **modular repair** and **community-based replication**  
- **No grid tie-in required**  
- Ships flat-packed or printed locally  
- Labels, QR guides, and visual assembly plans included (no language barrier)

## 👁️ Repo Name Meaning

> **“PeySookaBlyad”** — crude Russian transliteration of _“Drink, bitch”_

A street-level jab at the flood itself.  
You want to drown the city?  
**Drink this.**

---

## ✊ Why This Matters

**The Philippines floods every damn year.**  
Children swim in sewage.  
Phones go dead.  
Hospitals go dark.  
And the world scrolls past.

This repo doesn’t care about clicks.  
It cares about **dry feet** and **working phones**.

If you have the means — build it.  
If you don’t — fork it, improve it, and share it.

Either way:  
**Let’s make the flood drink first.**
