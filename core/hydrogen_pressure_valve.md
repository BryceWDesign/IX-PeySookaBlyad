# Hydrogen Pressure Valve Subsystem ‚Äî IX-PeySookaBlyad

This module governs **safe, rapid venting** of generated hydrogen gas during electrolysis operations in storm conditions.

Hydrogen must be **expelled immediately** to avoid:
- Compression buildup
- Unauthorized storage
- Delays in water throughput during heavy rainfall

## üí® Valve Type

| Feature          | Value                      |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Type             | Normally-closed solenoid valve  
| Size             | 1/4" BSP or compression fit  
| Material         | Stainless steel or brass, Viton seal  
| Pressure Rating  | 0‚Äì100 psi  
| Operating Voltage| 3.3V‚Äì5V (direct from ESP32 GPIO via MOSFET)  
| Activation Method| Software-controlled OR analog burst threshold

## üìü Control Logic

> Controlled by `storm_priority()` and `venting_flag` signals in firmware stack

### Basic Logic Flow:
```
IF (electrolysis_active == true) AND (sump_cm > threshold):
    enable_valve()
    delay(7000ms)
    disable_valve()
```

### Emergency Pressure Mode:
- Optional analog pressure sensor (e.g., MPX5700 or BMP280 repurposed for gas chamber)
- Override timer logic if pressure exceeds 30 psi
- Can trigger an LED beacon or warning tone

---

## üß± Physical Placement

- Located **above electrolysis chamber** in vertical escape stack  
- 20cm copper or PTFE tube guides gas vertically upward  
- Covered by angled weather shroud with screen to block debris/insects  
- Optional flame arrestor insert (sintered bronze)

## üîã Power Budget

| State        | Current Draw |
|--------------|--------------|
| Idle (closed)| 0 mA         |
| Open (active)| ~140‚Äì250 mA  |
| Burst Cycle  | ~2‚Äì4 seconds typical |
| Compatible With| PWM MOSFET driver (IRFZ44N or similar) |

---

## üß† Safety Notes

- Always vent into **open air**, never enclosed containers  
- Never store hydrogen ‚Äî vent it hot, wet, and gone  
- No flame/no spark zone enforced within 20cm  
- Optional redundancy: second mechanical pop-off valve at 40 psi

## ‚úÖ Summary

Hydrogen wants to float. Let it.  
This system opens a door, not a storage tank.  
Push it out, move the water, drop the flood.

This isn't about storing energy.  
It's about restoring streets.
