# Self-Cleaning Mode — IX-PeySookaBlyad

Flooding doesn’t stop for clogged filters.  
This module defines **passive and low-power systems** to keep the intake areas clear of debris, leaves, sediment, or oil buildup — without relying on expensive or breakable moving parts.

---

## 🌀 Passive Hydrodynamic Design

### 1. **Angled Cone Funnel**
- Internal water funnel is sloped at 15–25°
- Incoming water accelerates through venturi-style chamber
- Creates self-flushing motion as water volume increases

### 2. **Curved Skirt Deflection Lip**
- Bottom skirt includes rubber lip that redirects large debris outward
- Street-level debris slides over outer shell instead of pooling inward

### 3. **Rain Pressure Flush Assist**
- Top dome intake includes slight drop pipe
- During heavy rain, water flow rate is enough to dislodge clogs internally

---

## 🐍 Rodent & Insect Management

- All intakes lined with **steel or nylon mesh**
- Optional **citronella or peppermint oil pouches** mounted inside skirt to repel bugs/snakes
- Passive pest barriers only — no poisons or bait

---

## 💨 Optional Active Purge Logic (Advanced)

For high-debris zones, the following can be added:

### A. **Backpressure Pulse Valve**
- One-way flap or valve that opens briefly during low water level + full capacitor event
- Pushes 0.5s pulse of stored water outward through intake channel

### B. **Vibration Motor Assist**
- Low-frequency mini-motor mounted to internal bracket
- Triggered once daily or after rain stops
- Duration: ~3–5 seconds to shake internal debris loose

### C. **Overflow Channel Reset**
- Vertical sump pipe includes a 1-way drain to redirect slow sludge buildup downward during heavy use

## 🔋 Energy Budget Impact

| Feature                   | Power Draw | Runtime | Notes                         |
|--------------------------|------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Vibration motor (3V)     | ~50–80mA   | <5 sec  | Optional, capacitor-triggered |
| Pulse valve (solenoid)   | ~100mA     | 0.5 sec | Only used when idle + full cap|
| Passive hydrodynamics    | 0          | Always  | Preferred first layer defense |

---

## 🧰 Maintenance Interval Impact

With self-cleaning enabled:
- Skirt cleaning drops from every 2 weeks → every 2–3 months
- Full flush access only needed biannually
- Optional “shake + drain” cycle can be OTA triggered if mesh enabled

## ✅ Summary

Flood towers that clog don’t help anyone.  
This system is designed to **flush itself**, resist buildup, and never depend on human maintenance when it’s too late.

**If it rains, it rinses.  
If it idles, it cleans.  
If it floods — it’s ready.**
