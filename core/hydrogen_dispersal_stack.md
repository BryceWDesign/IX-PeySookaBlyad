# Hydrogen Dispersal Stack — IX-PeySookaBlyad

This module defines the safe, real-world dispersal stack for venting hydrogen and oxygen produced during electrolysis. No pressurized storage is used. All gases are immediately expelled into the open air.

---

## ⚗️ Core Principles

- **Hydrogen must be vented immediately** to avoid explosion risks
- **Oxygen must be separated and vented independently**
- **All vents must be protected from backflash, pests, and clogging**
- **System must be passive** (no fans or compressors required)

## 🧱 Stack Construction

### Hydrogen Vent Stack (Primary)

| Component           | Spec                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Material            | Aluminum or stainless steel tubing     |
| Diameter            | ~1 inch (25mm)                         |
| Height              | Extends 1–2 feet above electrolysis chamber |
| Cap                 | Rain-shielded, perforated dome cap     |
| Safety layer        | Mesh flash arrestor (SS304, 0.2mm mesh)|
| Mount               | Welded or clamped to chassis interior  |

### Oxygen Vent Port (Secondary)

| Component           | Spec                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Material            | PVC or ABS pipe                        |
| Diameter            | ~0.5 inch (12mm)                       |
| Exit angle          | 45° side-mounted hole in tower wall    |
| Screen              | Nylon or metal bug mesh                |
| Flow control        | None — fully open vent                 |

## 🧪 Safety Features

- **Flash Arrestor Mesh**: Prevents flame from traveling back into chamber in case of ignition
- **Always-open chimney vent**: Prevents hydrogen buildup
- **No check valves**: Avoids failure risk and back-pressure
- **Separation of H₂ and O₂ paths**: Reduces recombination hazard
- **Non-sparking materials**: Aluminum or stainless steel only (no copper/brass)

---

## 🌬️ Gas Flow Logic

1. Electrolysis generates H₂ and O₂
2. Hydrogen rises into chimney stack
3. Passes through mesh screen → exits freely
4. Oxygen vents sideways via secondary port
5. No mixing, no pressurization, no storage

---

## 🧼 Maintenance

- Visual inspection every 3–6 months
- Mesh can be rinsed or replaced if clogged with sediment or insects
- Rain cap may be wiped during dry season dust accumulation

---

## 💡 Enhancements (Optional)

- **Hydrogen fog ring**: Add a mist port near exhaust to humidify vent gas (visual effect only)
- **Glow ring**: LED ring around vent cap can be used to highlight active H₂ emission
- **Thermal strip**: Passive thermochromic paint can shift color when warm

## ✅ Summary

This isn’t a gas tank.  
It’s a **chimney for the storm**.  
The second hydrogen is born, it’s already leaving — harmless, fast, and clean.  
This system **doesn’t wait for permission to vent**. It just breathes.
