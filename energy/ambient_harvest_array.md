# Ambient Energy Harvesting Array â€” IX-PeySookaBlyad

This module defines the **multi-source ambient energy harvesting system**, designed to power:

- The towerâ€™s ESP32-C3 logic
- Status LED ring
- Wireless charger shelf
- Supplemental energy for suction relay, if battery drops

It scavenges free energy from **sunlight**, **vibrations**, **ambient radio waves**, and **temperature differentials**.

## âš¡ Source Matrix

| Source Type      | Method                              | Output Power (typical)         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Solar            | 12V flexible urban PV + DC buck     | 3â€“9W peak daytime             |
| Vibration        | Piezo panel inside base mount       | 50â€“200mW intermittent         |
| RF               | RF-to-DC scavenger (900MHzâ€“2.4GHz)  | 5â€“50mW                         |
| Thermal          | TEG between intake water and frame  | 100â€“300mW during rain         |

## ðŸ”‹ Energy Routing Logic

- All harvested energy is fed into a **central supercapacitor array**
- When capacitor > threshold â†’ feeds 5V DC bus  
- If main battery low, it **buffers critical systems**: ESP32 + LED + wireless shelf  
- If all else fails, priority is:
  1. Emergency flush  
  2. Status beacon  
  3. Wireless charger

## ðŸ”§ Mounting Design

- **Solar:** flexible strips glued onto circular dome cap + vertical shell  
- **Piezo:** bonded underneath suction pump cavity to capture pump or vibration shock  
- **TEG:** contact surface between rainwater pipe and warm inner shell  
- **RF:** internal SMA antenna + reflective base plane in cap

## âœ… Why This Matters

The grid goes out.

Floods rise.

Your towerâ€™s **last watt** decides whether a citizen knows itâ€™s alive â€” or not.

This system gives it the **power to whisper**, even when the worldâ€™s gone silent.

Harvest everything. Waste nothing.
